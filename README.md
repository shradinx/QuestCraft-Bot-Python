# QuestCraft-Bot-Python
An interactions.py bot made for QuestCraft

- All commands ran by the user are equipped with a print statement giving the username and the command ran.

NOTE: The token.txt file is required for this bot to work and must be in the same folder directory as the python file.

- I have not included the token.txt file as I do not want to leak my bot token (am smart)

Credits to the interactions.py Discord developers for advice on certain parts of the program.

Credits to Cartrigger for the original QuestCraft bot, written in JavaScript, along with *most*
  of the commands and outputs.
