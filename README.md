# QuestCraft-Bot-Python
An interactions.py bot made for QuestCraft

- All commands ran by the user are equipped with a print statement giving the username and the command ran.

NOTE: The token.txt file is required for this bot to work and must be in the same folder directory as the python file.
- I will not include my personal token.txt file, however you can create one by following these steps below.
    1. Download the python file
    2. In the same folder as the file, create a new .txt document titled token.txt
    3. Paste your token into the token.txt file you have created
- If you get an error where the file cannot be found:
    1. Make sure it is 100% in the same folder as your python file.
    2. (OPTIONAL) Use the exact file path to the file *format below*
        file = open(r"C:\Users\Example\Document\pythonBot\token.txt\")

- Credits to the interactions.py Discord developers for advice on certain parts of the program.
- Credits to Cartrigger for the original QuestCraft bot, written in JavaScript, along with *most*
  of the commands and outputs.
